### Filenames:
- The input file to the compiler, must have the extension `.eds`.
- An "included" file must have either the extension `.eds` or `.h`.

### Overloading:
- We allow function overloading.
- We do not allow the declaration of two functions with the same 
name and equivalent parameter lists. Two parameters are equivalent
if they have the same type. (We do not care about the pass method)
Two parameter lists are equivalent if their contents are equivalent.
- We use name mangling in both the symbol tables (Semantic analysis 
and IR Generation) and in the LLVM IR representation.
For the LLVM IR representation, the name mangling convention is the
following:

```
<mangled> ::= <original_name>_<parameters_str>_counter
<parameters_str> ::= <parameter_str>* 
```

The original name is the name of the function in the provided `.eds` 
file (as well as the included `.eds` or `.h` files).
The parameter string is created only from the explicit parameters of 
the function (meaning that we do not care about any parameters that
it accesses outside of its scope, that are not global, when the 
function is nested). We traverse the explicit parameters in order
and create a string for each parameter with the following correspondance:

```
<parameter_str> ::= <primitive_str> <pointer_str>
<primitive_str> ::= 'i' | 'd' | 'c' | 'b' // Corresponds to the types 'int', 'double', 'char', 'bool'
<pointer_str> ::= ([1-9][0-9]* | Îµ) // Corresponds to the "dimension" of the pointer. 
```

We also use a counter in case that two functions have the same name and 
explicit parameters. This can happen in the case of function shadowing
(a nested function shadows a function with the same name and parameters
from an outer scope), or when two functions have the same name and parameters 
but are also nested inside different functions.

### Type Casting:
- We allow every possible type casting between arithmetic types.
- We only allow a pointer to be cast to an int.
- We do not allow any arithmetic value to be cast into a pointer.
- We allow casting between pointer types freely.

### Labels:
- We do not allow two labels in the same function to have the same name.
- We only allow jumps to a label if the "jump" command is nested in the 
body of the labeled for-loop that is the jump destination.

### Static Array Declarations:
- When defining an array statically, the size of the array must be
a **positive** constant integer expression. A constant integer 
expression is a constant expression of type int, defined as stated below:
    > A constant integer expression can be:
    > 1. a constant int
    > 2. the result of the operations '+', '-', '*', '/', '%'
    > between two <ins>constant integer expressions</ins>
    > 3. a constant double, casted to an int
    > 4. the result of the operations '+', '-', '*', '/', '%'
    > between two constant doubles, casted to an int.
- Global arrays are initialized to contain zeros. This is not guaranteed
when declaring a local static array.

## Library Functions
- `readChar ()` does not "read" whitespaces. It is implemented by calling 
`scanf(" %c", &ref)`.
- `readString (int size, char * s)` reads at most `size - 1` characters from 
`stdin` and null-terminates the string properly, by placing a null byte as 
the `size`-th character in the provided buffer. The function reads from `stdin` 
as long as it has not reached `EOF` or it not read the newline char `'\n'`. The 
`'\n'` is not included in the returned string.

## Nested Functions
- In edsger, the programmer can nest functions. The nested functions can 
access variables from the outer scopes in which they are nested into, as
expected. This is implemented via lambda lifting.
