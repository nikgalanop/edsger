Basic instructions for dune:

dune build
dune exec edsger
dune clean


dune build - compiles all files it can find based on the "dune" files
dune exec edsger - executes the executable that results from Main.ml
dune clean - removes the _dune folder, which contains all the intermediate compilation files and the final executable.
